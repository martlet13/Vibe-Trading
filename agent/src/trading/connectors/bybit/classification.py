"""Curated read/write classification for supported Bybit ccxt operations.

Keys are the ccxt unified method names this connector uses. Order-mutating ccxt
calls are pinned WRITE so the live gate never treats them as plain reads;
anything unlisted and not a known read is treated as WRITE (fail-closed) by the
gate.
